abstract="On modern heterogeneous HPC systems, the most popular way to realize distributed computation is the hybrid programming model of MPI+X (X being OpenMP/CUDA/etc.), as it has been proven to perform well with various scientific applications. However, application developers prefer to use a single coherent programming model over a hybrid model, as maintainability and portability decrease per additional model. Recent workÂ [14] has shown that the OpenMP device offloading model could be used to program distributed accelerator-based HPC systems with minimal changes to the application.",
